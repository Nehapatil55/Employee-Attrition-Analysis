1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Dataset: A publicly available HR dataset containing employee attributes such as age, department, salary, years at the company, performance rating, and whether the employee left the organization (attrition status).
Tasks:
Handle missing values and outliers using Python.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., departments, education) using one-hot encoding.
Scale numerical features like salary and age using StandardScaler for better model performance.
EDA:
Analyze data distributions and relationships.
Visualize patterns in attrition rates using seaborn heatmaps and box plots.
2. Predictive Analysis Using Machine Learning:
Classification Models:
Logistic Regression: To establish a baseline model for binary classification.
Decision Tree: To explore feature importance and handle non-linear relationships.
Model Evaluation:
Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Cross-validation ensures robust results.
Feature Importance:
Identify the key drivers of attrition (e.g., low salary, long commute times, low engagement scores).
3. Visualization and Insights:
Dashboard Design:
Use Power BI/Tableau to create an interactive dashboard showcasing:
Attrition by Department: Highlight which departments face the highest attrition.
Age vs. Attrition: Show attrition trends across age groups.
Salary Bands vs. Attrition: Identify salary levels correlated with high attrition.
Key Factors: Visualize top factors influencing attrition using feature importance charts.
Example Charts:
Heatmaps of correlations between features.
Bar charts and pie charts to depict attrition distribution.
Line charts to show attrition trends over time.
