Description: Perform predictive analysis on an HR dataset to understand the factors contributing to employee attrition.

Tools: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn), Power BI/Tableau.

Steps:

Data Cleaning and EDA:
Use Python to preprocess and clean the HR dataset, ensuring data quality. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and relationships.
Machine Learning:
Build a classification model, such as Logistic Regression or Decision Tree, to predict whether an employee is likely to leave based on their attributes.
Visualization:
Create an interactive dashboard using Power BI/Tableau to present attrition trends, key contributing factors, and actionable insights.
Example Charts:

Attrition by Department.
Age vs. Attrition.
Salary Bands vs. Attrition.
Final Deliverable:

A Python notebook showcasing EDA, predictive modeling, and feature importance.
A Power BI dashboard visualizing the results and trends.
Insights shared via a LinkedIn post, accompanied by screenshots and a GitHub repository link.
